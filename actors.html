								Scouting Legion's Squad Leader.
								
								Hange is very passionate and driven in pursuit of new knowledge.
								 She can be seen as very hyperactive, 
								 often diving into projects without thought for personal safety 
								 (and frightening lots of subordinates in the process),
									instead preoccupied with observing and documenting the subjects.
									 Some misunderstand these acts and Hange is seen as eccentric 
									 and having more than a few screws loose. 
									 She also enjoys discussing this research, 
									 but as the lectures can be very long and detail-oriented, 
									 not many fellow soldiers find them interesting.

										Mikasa possesses impressive fighting skill and strength even as a child.
									
									As a teen, Mikasa is considered a genius among all the army trainees and is
									 incredibly skilled at combat and agility. 
									 She constantly worries for Eren's well-being and lives to protect him.</p>

										Levi is known as humanity's most powerful soldier. 
								He's ranked as Captain of the Scouting Legion division.
								 Levi is also the leader of the Special Operations Squad, 
								 an elite team that he hand-picked in order to protect Eren Yeager
								 . While it is said that he is blunt and unapproachable,
									it is noted that he has a strong respect for structure and discipline. 
									There are rumors that he was originally part of underground 
									crime before he became a soldier. Although he often appears to be unfriendly
									 he cares deeply for his team and has never undervalued human life.
									  He is also a notorious clean-freak.</p>

										Graduation Rank: Outside the top 10
										
										Eren's best friend, he is physically weak yet emotionally strong.
										 Even though lacking in actual combat skills,
											Armin is a genius in theoretical courses and can make plans even under extreme pressure.
											 Even so, Armin keeps on thinking that he is weak. 
											 He himself does not notice the things he does for Eren and Mikasa, 
											 and believes himself to be completely incompetent and hates himself 
											 for having to rely on Eren and Mikasa.
